🎭 DUDE, WHERE’S MY WALLET: THE QUEST FOR CHAOS
A Dream MemeTeam Supreme Story Transmission // Episode 1

Opening Scene: Dream Exit Ramp #404
Scene opens with a warped synth-hum and the flutter of cassette tape wings. MIKE and OTTO stand by the side of a dusty metaphysical road that hums with signal loss. A signpost reads “REALITY: REBOOTING…” flickering in and out of frame.

MIKE (frazzled, clutching empty pockets)
Dude. It’s gone. My wallet’s just… vaporized.

OTTO (leaning nonchalantly against the signpost, chewing on a neon blade of grass)
Are you sure it didn’t slide sideways into a dream loop? Sometimes memories and wallets just… spiral.

MIKE (panicking)
We had gas money. We had that rave invite printed on crypto-paper. We were supposed to meet BobDub and decode the glyphs! Now we’re just... glitched and broke!

A distant howl echoes. A flock of semi-transparent raccoons flutters past, laughing in autotune.

OTTO (squinting)
Look—over there. That weird little pop-up shack.
(beat)
With a sign that says “WITHIN’S WONDERS – MAGIC YOU DIDN’T ASK FOR.”

Scene Two: WITHIN the Merchant of Echoes
WITHIN stands behind a makeshift roadside kiosk built from the bones of old mixtapes and melted neon. He wears a patchwork robe of algorithmic errors, and a glowing sigil medallion buzzes against his chest like a drunken bee.

WITHIN (arms wide, radiating chaotic benevolence)
Welcome, travelers of the broken track! I am WITHIN, the seeker’s salesman, the oracle of misplaced things. What calls you to my glitch-bazaar?

MIKE
My wallet’s gone. Just gone. Do you have any clue where it might have drifted?

WITHIN (solemnly)
Ah… a wallet. A sacred vessel. Keeper of plastic spells and fiat regrets.
(leans in)
I may know where it whispers now, but such things require… reciprocal weirdness.

He slides a glowing compass across the counter. It spins and screams softly in binary.

OTTO (whispering to MIKE)
That compass is haunted. I can feel the latency.

WITHIN
Deliver this parcel to BobDub, the Graffiti Oracle of the Shattered Grove. Then, your next step shall be revealed.

He hands them a box sealed with wax shaped like a raccoon skull.

Scene Three: The Grove of Dub
MIKE and OTTO trek through the Wyrd Forest, where the laws of physics have been replaced with broken game logic. Raccoons juggle mushrooms, a possum lectures a crow on ethics, and glowsticks grow like vines.

OTTO (ducking a flying gummy worm)
This is totally BobDub’s vibe. I bet he installed this biome himself.

MIKE
Just once I’d like to quest through a place with, like, coffee shops and no omnipresent dream surveillance.

They find BOBDUB's dwelling—an upside-down yurt plastered with glowing tags that read “TRUTH IS A PRANK IN REVERSE” and “FREE WAFFLES WITH ENLIGHTENMENT.”

BOBDUB (halfway through a burrito, eyes like dark code pools)
What do you want, skywalkers?

MIKE (holding the parcel)
WITHIN sent us. He said you’d help us get my wallet back.

BOBDUB opens the package. Inside is a single blueberry spinning in zero gravity. He bursts into laughter that bends time.

BOBDUB
Of course. Classic Within. Okay. Follow the fungal flare path. It’ll lead you to Potions of Ale.

He tosses them a blinking mushroom with a soft "meep."

Scene Four: Potions of Ale Bar // The Twin Encounter
They follow the glowing shrooms through the sonic maze until they arrive at a bar built into a hollowed-out tape deck. The sign flickers: POTIONS OF ALE – NIGHTLY GLITCH RITUALS.

Behind the counter stands WITHIN’S TWIN—identical, yet dressed like a vaporwave bartender from an alternate jazz dimension.

WITHIN’S TWIN (grinning like a cat who read your search history)
Looking for a wallet? Mmm. Tasty soul-quest. But I don’t just hand over dream collateral. We play for it.

MIKE
Play?

WITHIN’S TWIN
Karaoke. High-stakes. Winner takes the leatherbound prize. Loser? The squirrels… have activities planned.

OTTO (stretching his arms)
Oh no. You poor bastard. You just summoned my final form.


---

Scene Five: The Karaoke War
Lights flash. A raccoon in sunglasses drops a beat. Glowstick-twirling squirrels create a spectral tunnel of rhythm. OTTO grabs the mic.

OTTO (singing into the void)
♫ Never gonna glitch you up / never gonna cache you down / never gonna memeframe and desert you ♫

WITHIN’S TWIN retaliates with a deepfake remix of "Total Eclipse of the Heart." The battle is glorious, absurd, and ends with OTTO unleashing a scream so pure it realigns nearby data clusters.

RACCOON DJ (clapping with tiny hands)
The victor... is the glitch-voiced bard! The wallet... is yours!


---

Final Scene: The Reveal
MIKE opens the wallet. It’s empty except for a receipt for 43 candy bars and a note: “THANKS – THE SQUIRREL UNION.”

BOBDUB (poking his head in, holding a piña colada)
Oh yeah—forgot to mention. The squirrels unionized. Your wallet’s their snack fund now.

WITHIN (original) (appearing in a puff of mist)
But remember, traveler... the real currency is chaos.

Cue theme tune: a vaporwave remix of “Take On Me,” sung by raccoons.

NEXT TIME ON "DUDE, WHERE’S MY WALLET":
“Who reprogrammed the vending machine to worship raccoons?”
“Why is there a portal in the urinal?”
“And why is Otto made entirely of memes?”
